This project aims to design and build an automatic medicine dispensing system to help elderly people take their medicines on time without needing constant supervision. Many older adults forget to take their medicines or take them incorrectly, which can cause serious health problems. This system uses modern technology like sensors, LED lights, alarms, and a display screen to make the process easy and safe.
The device has six boxes for medicines — two for each meal (before and after breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Each box has a sensor to detect if the medicine is taken and an LED light to show which medicine should be taken at that time. The system also has a display showing medicine details and a buzzer alarm to remind the patient. If the patient presses the remote accept button, a motorized tray moves the correct box in front of them. After taking the medicine, the tray moves back automatically. If the patient forgets or skips the dose, the system alerts them again. This project helps improve medication management, ensures safety, and builds trust between patients and caregivers.
